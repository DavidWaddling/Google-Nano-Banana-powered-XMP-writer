The purpose of this app is to take an image file that you have created and plan on editing and assist with the inbedded information.

When you import images into Lightroom (I'll use that as an example) you don't just edit the image lighting, cropping, and so on, you also get to add other information to the file. 
This includes: 
  1. Title
  2. Description
  3. Keywords
  4. Location (GPS co ordinance)
This software allows you to drag and drop up to 5 images into a dialogue box.
Entre the location or attraction for the images (ie: Toronto or Niagara Falls)
Submitting the images will instruct Gemini to analyse each photo, create the four elements listed above, and output them to a valid image sidecar file. This file will be named the same as your image file with a .xmp extension and can be downloaded to your system.

If you put this file in the same directory as the original file you imported from your camera you can add the info to your image in Lightroom by opening the image you want to update, click metafile - Read metadata from file.

Enjoy.
Dave
